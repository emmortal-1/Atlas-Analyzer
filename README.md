# CS256-lab7-files
This assignment is very open-ended, allowing you to use any libraries, code you find, anything you want is ok. Use one of the concepts we covered this week to create a program that does something. For example, you can create a program that does something with files, such as opening a csv file and manipulating data with pandas in a spreadsheet. Or, you can use requests/ beautiful soup to do something with web data. You can even build a flask app if that is your jam. If you are asking, what should I do-- do something that would demonstrate your understanding on a topic that you could put in your github repository for a portfolio piece. If you are a math major, do something math related. If you are a CS major, building a CS portfolio is important, and showcasing your Python skills is a great start. If you do something that requires instructions, add a README that explains to the user what they will need to install, and what they will need to do to run your program.
